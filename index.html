        <p>Hello! I am a University of Texas graduate with a bachelors degree in Economics(major) 
            and Computer Science (minor)! I have additionally chosen to further my Computer Science
            knowedge and skills by attending a 6 month fullstack web developement bootcamp!
            I consider myself a lifelong learner and love to tinker with technology and mechanical devices.
            <br><br><br>
            Outside of the professional world I enjoy playing and teaching guitar!
            I started playing music when I was 12 and have been in a variety of bands of the years.
            I like being outside (hiking/fishing) as well as lifting weights and staying in shape!
        </p>
